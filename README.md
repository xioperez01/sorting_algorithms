# Sorting algorithms & Big O ( :repeat_one: :1234: :capital_abcd: ) :nerd_face:  #
A **sorting algorithm** is an algorithm made up of a series of instructions that takes an array as input, performs specified operations on the array, sometimes called a list, and outputs a sorted array.
**Sorting arranges data in a sequence which makes searching easier.**
### Big O notation ###
Big O notation is a notation used when talking about growth rates. It formalizes the notion that two functions "grow at the same rate," or one function "grows faster than the other," and such.
Algorithms have a specific running time, usually declared as a function on its input size
Thus, instead, we often talk about an algorithm's growth rate; whether the algorithm only takes time proportional to its input size (linear), or the square of the size (quadratic), or perhaps it doesn't depend on its input size (constant). This is formalized in big O notation, stating that the algorithm above runs in "quadratic time," or "O(n^2)"
